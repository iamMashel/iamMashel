# **👁️ Who the Hell Am I?**  
I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** who builds **scalable, efficient, and production-ready ML systems.** Unlike most so-called "AI experts," I don’t just train models—I make sure they actually work in **production** without falling apart like a junior dev’s first API.  

## **🛠️ My Tech Stack (A.K.A. The Only Tools That Matter)**  
🔹 **Languages:** Python, Go, Rust (because efficiency matters)  
🔹 **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn  
🔹 **Data Engineering:** Apache Airflow, Spark, Snowflake  
🔹 **MLOps:** MLflow, Kubeflow, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes  
🔹 **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana (because ignorance isn’t bliss)  

## **🔮 What I Work On**  
- **ML Infrastructure** → Scalable, reliable, and **doesn’t crash at 3 AM.**  
- **Model Deployment** → ML that actually runs **outside a Jupyter notebook.**  
- **MLOps Automation** → Because doing things manually is for **cavemen.**  
- **Deep Learning & Optimization** → Not for hype, but for **real-world impact.**  

## **📖 What You Won’t Find Here**  
❌ Useless ML projects trained on **MNIST for the 1,000th time.**  
❌ Half-baked Python scripts that "just kinda work."  
❌ AI-generated README files (Ironic, isn’t it?)  

## **📫 How to Reach Me**  
If you need help with **ML systems, deployment, or security**, message me. If you’re here to talk about **NFTs, "prompt engineering," or how AI is going to "replace programmers,"** don’t.  

**Now, go do something productive.** Or don’t. I don’t care.
