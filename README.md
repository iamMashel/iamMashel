<h2 align="center">Systems Architect | Machine Learning Engineer | Security Expert</h2>

# **👁️ Who the Hell Am I?**  
I’m a **Systems Architect & Machine Learning Engineer** who builds **scalable, secure, and production-ready** systems. Unlike most so-called "AI experts," I don’t just train models—I ensure they actually work in **production** without crumbling like a junior dev’s first API. And unlike most system architects, I prioritize **performance, security, and maintainability** over bloated enterprise nonsense.  

## **🛠️ My Tech Stack (A.K.A. The Only Tools That Matter)**  
🔹 **Languages:** Python, Go, Rust (because efficiency and security matter)  
🔹 **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn  
🔹 **Data Engineering:** Apache Airflow, Spark, Snowflake  
🔹 **MLOps:** MLflow, Kubeflow, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes  
🔹 **Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS, GCP, Azure (because vendor lock-in is for amateurs)  
🔹 **Security & DevOps:** Zero Trust, OAuth2, Argon2, SELinux, Ansible  
🔹 **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki (because ignorance isn’t bliss)  

## **🔮 What I Work On**  
- **ML Infrastructure** → Scalable, reliable, and **doesn’t crash at 3 AM.**  
- **Model Deployment** → ML that actually runs **outside a Jupyter notebook.**  
- **MLOps Automation** → Because doing things manually is for **cavemen.**  
- **Deep Learning & Optimization** → Not for hype, but for **real-world impact.**  
- **Backend Architecture** → APIs and microservices that don’t suck.  
- **Cloud Security** → Because leaving your S3 bucket public is a **rookie mistake.**  
- **Zero Trust Security** → Assume everything is compromised and design accordingly.  

## **🔒 System Architecture & Security Principles**  
🔹 **Zero Trust Everything** – Assume every request is hostile. Verify constantly.  
🔹 **Least Privilege Access** – If your service has unnecessary permissions, you’ve already failed.  
🔹 **End-to-End Encryption** – If it's not encrypted, it’s compromised.  
🔹 **Idempotency & Fault Tolerance** – Build APIs and systems that don’t fail like a house of cards.  
🔹 **Observability > Guesswork** – Metrics, logging, and monitoring should be **baked in** from day one.  
🔹 **Automate or Regret It Later** – DevSecOps isn’t optional. It’s survival.  

## **📖 What You Won’t Find Here**  
❌ Overengineered garbage that exists just to flex tech stacks.  
❌ AI "projects" that are just pre-trained models repackaged.  
❌ Security advice that doesn’t assume **worst-case scenarios.**  
❌ Useless cloud diagrams that look fancy but mean nothing.

## **📫 How to Reach Me**  
If you need help with **system architecture, ML engineering, or security**, message me. If you’re here to talk about **NFTs, "prompt engineering," or why JavaScript is the future of AI**, don’t.
